**Bingo.** You've got the basic architecture down like a natural. Here's how the two halves work:

---

## ⚙️ FRONTEND vs BACKEND — In ProjectWIPR Context

---

### 🎨 FRONTEND (What you *see* and *interact* with)

> 🧠 Think: **Admin Control Panel**

* Built with **React + Tailwind (via shadcn-admin)** or Next.js
* Handles:

  * Login screen
  * Formula/Tier dashboards
  * Buttons, inputs, sliders, console UI
  * Validation messages
  * Visual previews of changes
* Calls backend with HTTP requests (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
* Looks *cyberpunk-formal* — neon edges, soft glows, clean layout

---

### 🛠️ BACKEND (What *stores*, *calculates*, *saves*)

> 🧠 Think: **Brain and Vault**

* Could be:

  * **Express.js server** (JS option)
  * **Next.js API routes** (if using Next)
  * Later: **Node + PostgreSQL** or Prisma ORM
* Handles:

  * Authenticating admins (only trusted logins)
  * Storing all:

    * Formulas
    * Tiers
    * Logs
  * CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  * Logic test evaluator (optional sandboxed formula tester)
  * Version tracking / undo logs

## 💡 Flow Example

Let’s say Pillar wants to add a formula:

1. 🧑‍💻 **Frontend**: They go to `/formulas`, type `helped another member = +10`, hit save.
2. 🌐 **Frontend sends POST request** to backend API:

   ```json
   {
     "action": "helped another member",
     "points": 10
   }
   ```
3. 🧠 **Backend** stores it in a database or `formulas.json`, logs the change.
4. 🧪 If a test console is used, frontend may request live calculation (`POST /test-formula`)

## 🔐 Security Design Tip

Only let logged-in admin users access anything that writes or changes. Add a simple **JWT-based login** or use local mock auth during testing.

## 🧱 TL;DR

| Layer    | Tech Example               | Purpose                       |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend | React + Tailwind (shadcn)  | UI, forms, inputs             |
| Backend  | Node.js + Express          | Store data, secure, calculate |
| Storage  | JSON → SQLite → PostgreSQL | Save formulas, tiers, logs    |
